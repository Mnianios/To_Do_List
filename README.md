Created a console-based To-Do List application using Java that allows users to manage tasks by adding, marking them as completed, and viewing their task list.

Features:
Designed a menu system for easy task management.
Provides user input validation to ensure only valid tasks can be added.
Utilizes data structures (like ArrayLists) to efficiently store, manage, and separate active and completed tasks.
Generates a unique ID for each task using an algorithm based on the task nameâ€™s hash code and the current timestamp.
Automatically assigns the date of creation to each task for better tracking.
